# Smartphone Price Classification with SVM

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify smartphones into price ranges based on their technical specifications.

## Data
The dataset includes features like battery power, RAM, processor cores, screen size, etc.

## Pipeline
- Load training and test data (CSV)
- Preprocessing: feature selection and scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training with SVM (rbf kernel)
- Evaluation: accuracy and confusion matrix

## How to run
```bash
python main.py
